# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
Version control is a method of creating multiple instances of a file which can be worked on and saved individually. Version control is important because it allows for numerous individuals to work on one file simultaneously while preserving the integrity of the master file. Version control records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. This method increases efficiency by allowing multiple people to work on a file at one time. Version control also mitigates the danger of damage being done to the master file, by allowing for the ability to roll back to a previous point in time or a different version. 

* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
A branch is a diversion from the main line of a code development project. A developer should use branches to work on a development project without potentially doing damage to the main line of development (i.e. the master). Code developed in the branch should be merged into the master once complete.

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
A commit is a change to a repository. A good commit message is descriptive and concise, allowing other users to clearly understand the change that was made to the repository.

* **What is a merge conflict?**
A merge conflict is an error that prevents merging a branch into the master file.

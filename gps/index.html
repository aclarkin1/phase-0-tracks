    <p>Hey Anon, Admin Jessica here. Otis is A-OK, the blog is just on a bit of a hiatus as Ben has been pretty sick for the last few weeks (you can read more here). As soon as he’s feeling better, we’ll have more pictures to share of everyone’s favorite corgi :) Thanks for your concern!</p>

  <p><em>Aaron Larkin's reflection on GPS 1.2.</em></p>
  <ol>
    <li><em><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? - </strong>Semantic tags are HTML5 elements used to reinforce the semantics, or meanings, of a webpage. I think the "nav" tag is especially useful, as it is usually present on each page and links the various sections of the website together.</em></li>
    <li><em><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? - </strong>All content inside the body element is part of a section. Explicitly defined sections are the content with body, section, article, aside, and nav tags.</em></li>
    <li><em><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? - </strong>The concept of sublime snippets was totatally new to me in this challenge. Unfortunately, I'm using Cloud9 (and not Sublime) so I will probably not be using snippets going forward.</em></li>
    <li><em><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? - </strong>I found it difficult to understand in what context to use the various semantic elements. I will study the flowchart in the GPS 1.2 instructions in order to gain a better understanding of how these elements are used.</em></li>
